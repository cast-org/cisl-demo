<h1>Should people continue to eat meat?</h1>
<p>After reading the book Charlotte’s Web, 10-year-old Alia made a big decision. She decided she would not eat meat anymore. She did not want animals to be killed for food. Her story is not unique. Lately many children are choosing to be vegetarian.</p>

<p>Vegetarians do not eat any beef, pork, chicken, fish, or other meats. Some vegetarians choose their meat-free diet for health reasons. Some choose this diet because of their concern for animals, and others because of their concern for the environment.</p>
<p>Meat consumption has been linked to health problems such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and increased rates of diabetes and heart disease. By replacing meat with beans and nuts, vegetarians eat a diet lower in saturated fat and higher in fiber than meat eaters.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, eating meat is a good way for people to get enough protein, iron, and vitamin B12, since it contains all of these nutrients. In contrast, vegetarians have to plan their meals carefully to get all their nutrients.</p>
<p>Some people say that meat doesn’t just taste good; it is also part of the American way of life. A roasted turkey is symbolic of Thanksgiving. Hamburgers and hot dogs are traditional foods for Fourth of July barbecues. Beef chili, barbecued ribs, and southern fried chicken are all classic American foods. For some Americans, eliminating meat would be like giving up an essential part of our culture and traditions.</p>

<p>Could the American tradition of eating meat be hurting the earth? Raising animals and transporting meat creates almost one-fifth of the earth’s greenhouse gases. This is more than the greenhouse gases produced by cars, trucks, trains, and airplanes combined. In addition, almost half of the water used in the U.S. goes to raising livestock.</p>
<p>Most of the beef produced domestically is eaten by Americans. However, exports are also increasing as more countries add meat into their daily diets. As a result, the meat industry is thriving. Reducing meat consumption could damage an important domestic industry, hurting the economy and taking away precious jobs.</p>
<p>Some people choose another option. “Flexitarians” are vegetarians who eat meat occasionally. Flexitarians believe that a diet should be mostly plant-based, but that meat and fish can be healthy and responsible choices if consumed in moderation.</p>
<p>With all of the benefits of vegetarianism, should people continue to eat meat? Are tradition and industry more important than the environment and health benefits?</p>
