    <p>Lieutenant Nunn, of the Navy arrived this morning at Lord Dartmouth's
    and brought letters from General Gage, Lord Percy, and Lieutenant-Colonel
    Smith, containing the following particulars of what passed on the
    nineteenth of April last between a detachment of the King's Troops in the
    Province of Massachusetts-Bay and several parties of rebel provincials
    .... Lieutenant-Colonel Smith finding, after he had advanced some miles on
    his march, that the country had been alarmed by the firing of guns and
    ringing of bells, dispatched six companies of light-infantry, in order to
    secure two bridges on different roads beyond Concord, who, <!--hint ref="3"-->upon
    their arrival at Lexington, found a body of the country people under arms,
    on a green close to the road;<!--/hint--> and upon the King's Troops
    marching up to them, in order to inquire the reason of their being so
    assembled, they went off in great confusion, and <!--hint ref="1"-->several
    guns were fired upon the King's troops from behind a stone wall, and also
    from the meeting-house and other houses, by which one man was wounded, and
    Major Pitcairn's horse shot in two places.<!--/hint--> In consequence of
    this attack by the rebels, the troops returned the fire and killed several
    of them. After which the detachment marched on to Concord without any
    thing further happening. </p>

    <p><!--hint ref="3"-->The troops came in sight just before sunrise...the
    Commanding Officer accosted the militia in words to this effect:
    "Disperse, you rebels, damn you, throw down your arms and disperse;" upon
    which the troops huzzaed, <!--hint ref="1"-->and immediately one or two
    officers discharged their pistols, which were instantaneously followed by
    the firing of four or five of the soldiers, and then there seemed to be a
    general discharge from the whole body.<!--/hint--> Eight of our men were
    killed and nine wounded.<!--/hint--> </p>

    <h2>Deposition</h2>

    <p>The legal document below is the testimony of one of the colonists at
    the Battle of Lexington which happened on April 19, 1775 in Lexington,
    Massachusetts. The testimony was recorded seven days after the battle. How
    does Captain Parker want you to feel about the American colonists? How
    does he want you to feel about the British soldiers? What word choices
    does Captain Parker use to encourage you to form an opinion about each
    group? <!----></p>

    <div> <strong>Deposed:</strong> Captain John Parker (Colonial
    Militia)<br/> <strong>Year Created:</strong> April 26, 1775<br/>
    <strong>Type:</strong> Deposition<br/> </div>

    <p>[I] ordered our Militia to meet on the common in said Lexington, to
    consult what to do, and concluded not to be discovered, nor meddle or make
    with said Regular Troops (if they should approach) unless they should
    insult us; and upon their sudden approach, <!--hint ref="2"--><!--hint ref="3"-->I
    immediately ordered our Militia to disperse and not to fire.<!--/hint--><!--/hint-->
    <!--hint ref="1"-->Immediately said Troops made their appearance, and
    rushed furiously, fired upon and killed eight of our party,<!--/hint-->
    <!--hint ref="3"-->without receiving any provocation from us.<!--/hint-->

    <h2>Diary Entry</h2>

    <p>The diary entry here was written by a British army soldier the same day
    as the Battle of Lexington, April 19, 1775. As you read through this
    document, think about how Lieutenant Barker describes the events leading
    up to the battle. What does Lieutenant Barker say happened? What words and
    details help you understand how the British soldiers were feeling,
    thinking, and acting? Does the fact that this is a diary entry make it
    more, or less, convincing to you? <!----></p>

    <strong>Date:</strong> April 19, 1775<br/> <strong>Type:</strong> Diary
    Entry<br/> </div>

    <p>19th. At 2 o'clock we began our march by wading through a very long
    ford up to our middles; after going a few miles we took three or four
    people who were going off to give intelligence; about five miles on this
    side of a town called Lexington, which lay in our road, <!--hint ref="3"-->we
    heard there were some hundreds of people collected together intending to
    oppose us and stop our going on;<!--/hint--> at 5 o'clock we arrived
    there, and saw a number of people, <!--hint ref="4"-->I believe between
    200 and 300, formed in a common in the middle of the town;<!--/hint--> we
    still continued advancing, keeping prepared against an attack though
    without intending to attack them; <!--hint ref="2"-->but <!--hint ref="1"-->on
    our coming near them they fired one or two shots<!--/hint-->, upon which
    our men without any orders, rushed in upon them, fired and put them to
    flight;<!--/hint--> several of them were killed, we could not tell how
    many, because they were got behind walls and into the woods; We had a man
    of the 10th light Infantry wounded, nobody else hurt. We then formed on
    the Common, but with some difficulty, the men were so wild they could hear
    no orders; we waited a considerable time there, and at length proceeded on
    our way to Concord. </p>

    <h2>Etching</h2>

    <p>This drawing was created shortly after the Battle of Lexington, which
    happened on April 19, 1775, and was widely distributed throughout the
    American colonies. As you look at the image, think about how the artist’s
    choices show his opinion about what happened. What details might reveal
    the artist’s opinion about who was to blame for the battle? How are the
    British soldiers portrayed? How are the American colonists drawn? <!----></p>

    <h2>Report</h2>

    <p>This document is a report sent by a leader of the British troops at the
    Battle of Lexington to his commanding officer. The battle occurred on
    April 19, 1775 and this report was sent seven days after the battle. As
    you read the report, look for how Major Pitcairn wants his commanding
    officer to view Pitcairn’s actions, the British soldiers, and the American
    colonists. What details show you how he wants the General to think about
    each of these? <!----></p>

    to General Gage<br/> </div>

    <p>Sir,</p>

    <p>As you are anxious to know the particulars that happened near and at
    Lexington in the 19th ... I will be as concise a manner as possible to
    state the facts.</p>

    <p><!--hint ref="2"-->I gave directions to the Troops to move forward, but
    on no account to Fire, or even attempt it without orders;<!--/hint--> when
    I arrived at the end of the Village, <!--hint ref="4"-->I observed drawn
    upon a Green near 200 of the Rebels;<!--/hint--> when I came within about
    One Hundred Yards of them, they began to File off towards some stone Walls
    on our Right Flank The Light Infantry observing this, ran after them <!--hint ref="2"-->I
    instantly called to the Soldiers not to fire,<!--/hint--> but to surround
    and disarm them, <!--hint ref="1"-->and after several repetitions of those
    positive Orders to the men <!--hint ref="3"-->some Rebels who had jumped
    over the Wall, Fired Four or Five Shott at the Soldiers,<!--/hint--> which
    wounded a man of the Tenth, and my Horse was Wounded in two places and at
    the same time several Shott were fired from a Meeting House on our
    Left<!--/hint--> upon this, without any order or Regularity, the Light
    Infantry began a scattered Fire, and continued in that situation for some
    little time, contrary to the repeated orders both of me and the officers
    that were present.</p>

    <p>I am, Sir, Your Most Obedient Humble Servant</p>

    <p>John Pitcairn</p>

    <h2>Sworn Deposition</h2>

    <p>The legal document below is a summary of testimony of twenty-one
    American colonists at the Battle of Lexington, gathered by Joseph Warren,
    an American colonist. The battle itself happened on April 19, 1775 in
    Lexington, Massachusetts and this testimony was recorded seven days after
    the battle. How does Joseph Warren feel about the troops commanded by
    General Gage? How does he feel about the inhabitants of Lexington? What
    details help you discover how Warren feels? <!----></p>

    <div> <strong>Deposed:</strong> 21 Lexington Residents<br/>
    <strong>Title:</strong> To the Inhabitants of Great Britain<br/>
    <strong>Year Created:</strong> April 26, 1775<br/> <strong>Type:</strong>
    Sworn Deposition<br/> </div>

    <p>To the inhabitants of Great Britain: In Provincial Congress, Watertown,
    April 26, 1775 </p>

    <p>Friends and fellow subjects: Hostilities are at length commenced in the
    Colony by the troops under command of General Gage; and it being of the
    greatest importance that an early, true, and authentic account of this
    inhuman proceeding should be known to you, the Congress of this Colony
    have transmitted the same, and from want of a session of the honorable
    Continental Congress, think it proper to address you on the alarming
    occasion. </p>

    <p>By the clearest depositions relative to this transaction, it will
    appear that on the night preceding the nineteenth of April instant ... the
    Town of Lexington ... was alarmed, and a company of the inhabitants
    mustered on the occasion; that the Regular troops, on their way to
    Concord, marched into the said town of Lexington, and <!--hint ref="3"-->the
    said company, on their approach, began to disperse;<!--/hint--> that
    notwithstanding this, <!--hint ref="1"-->the regulars rushed on with great
    violence, and first began hostilities by firing on said Lexington Company,
    whereby they killed eight and wounded several others;<!--/hint--> that the
    Regulars continued their fire until those of said company, who were
    neither killed nor wounded, had made their escape. </p>

    <p>These, brethren, are marks of ministerial vengeance against this
    colony, for refusing, with her sister colonies, a submission to slavery.
    But they have not yet detached us from our Royal Sovereign. We profess to
    be his loyal and dutiful subjects, and so hardly dealt with as we have
    been, are still ready, with our lives and fortunes, to defend his person,
    family, crown, and dignity. Nevertheless, to the persecution and tyranny
    of his cruel ministry we will not tamely submit; appealing to Heaven for
    the justice of our cause, we determine to die or be free.</p>

    <p>Joseph Warren </p>
