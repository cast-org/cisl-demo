<p>19th. At 2 o'clock we began our march by wading through a very long ford up to our middles;
 after going a few miles we took three or four people who were going off to give intelligence;
 about five miles on this side of a town called Lexington, which lay in our road, <!--hint ref="3"-->we heard there
 were some hundreds of people collected together intending to oppose us and stop our going on;<!--/hint--> 
at 5 o'clock we arrived there, and saw a number of people, <!--hint ref="4"-->I believe between 200 and 300, formed 
in a common in the middle of the town;<!--/hint--> we still continued advancing, keeping prepared against an 
attack though without intending to attack them; <!--hint ref="2"-->but <!--hint ref="1"-->on our coming near them they fired one or two 
shots<!--/hint-->, upon which our men without any orders, rushed in upon them, fired and put them to flight;<!--/hint--> 
several of them were killed, we could not tell how many, because they were got behind walls and 
into the woods; We had a man of the 10th light Infantry wounded, nobody else hurt. We then formed
 on the Common, but with some difficulty, the men were so wild they could hear no orders; 
we waited a considerable time there, and at length proceeded on our way to Concord.

<p>Sir,</p> 
<p>As you are anxious to know the particulars that happened near and at Lexington in the 19th ... 
I will be as concise a manner as possible to state the facts.</p>

<p><!--hint ref="2"-->I gave directions to the Troops to move forward, but on no account to Fire, or even attempt 
it without orders;<!--/hint--> when I arrived at the end of the Village, <!--hint ref="4"-->I observed drawn upon a Green near 
200 of the Rebels;<!--/hint--> when I came within about One Hundred Yards of them, they began to File off 
towards some stone Walls on our Right Flank The Light Infantry observing this, ran after them 
<!--hint ref="2"-->I instantly called to the Soldiers not to fire,<!--/hint--> but to surround and disarm them, <!--hint ref="1"-->and after 
several repetitions of those positive Orders to the men <!--hint ref="3"-->some Rebels who had jumped over the Wall,
 Fired Four or Five Shott at the Soldiers,<!--/hint--> which wounded a man of the Tenth, and my Horse was 
Wounded in two places and at the same time several Shott were fired from a Meeting House on our 
Left<!--/hint--> upon this, without any order or Regularity, the Light Infantry began a scattered Fire, and 
continued in that situation for some little time, contrary to the repeated orders both of me and 
the officers that were present.</p>

<p>I am, Sir, Your Most Obedient
Humble Servant</p>

<h2>Sworn Deposition</h2>

<div> 
  <strong>Deposed:</strong> 21 Lexington Residents<br />
  <strong>Title:</strong> To the Inhabitants of Great Britain<br />
  <strong>Year Created:</strong> April 26, 1775<br />
  <strong>Type:</strong> Sworn Deposition<br />
</div>

<p>To the inhabitants of Great Britain: In Provincial Congress, Watertown, April 26, 1775 </p>

<p>Friends and fellow subjects: Hostilities are at length commenced in the Colony by the troops under
 command of General Gage; and it being of the greatest importance that an early, true, and authentic 
account of this inhuman proceeding should be known to you, the Congress of this Colony have transmitted
 the same, and from want of a session of the honorable Continental Congress, think it proper to address 
you on the alarming occasion. </p>

<p>By the clearest depositions relative to this transaction, it will appear that on the night 
preceding the nineteenth of April instant ... the Town of Lexington ... was alarmed, and a company
 of the inhabitants mustered on the occasion; that the Regular troops, on their way to Concord,
 marched into the said town of Lexington, and <!--hint ref="3"-->the said company, on their approach, began to disperse;<!--/hint-->
 that notwithstanding this, <!--hint ref="1"-->the regulars rushed on with great violence, and first began hostilities 
by firing on said Lexington Company, whereby they killed eight and wounded several others;<!--/hint--> that 
the Regulars continued their fire until those of said company, who were neither killed nor wounded,
 had made their escape. </p>

<p>These, brethren, are marks of ministerial vengeance against this colony, for refusing, with her
 sister colonies, a submission to slavery. But they have not yet detached us from our Royal Sovereign. 
We profess to be his loyal and dutiful subjects, and so hardly dealt with as we have been, are still
 ready, with our lives and fortunes, to defend his person, family, crown, and dignity. Nevertheless, 
to the persecution and tyranny of his cruel ministry we will not tamely submit; appealing to Heaven 
for the justice of our cause, we determine to die or be free.</p> 

<p>Joseph Warren
