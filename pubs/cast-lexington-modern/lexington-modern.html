    <p>Navy Lieutenant Nunn arrived this morning at Lord Dartmouth's with
    letters from General Gage, Lord Percy, and Lieutenant-Colonel Smith
    concerning the events that occurred on April 19th and involved the British
    troops, the colonial militia, and several rebel parties.
    Lieutenant-Colonel Smith was concerned about the chaos that was occurring
    north of Boston and sent six light infantry companies to secure two
    bridges near Concord. On their way to complete this order, <!--hint ref="3"-->the
    companies found a group of armed country people near the road in
    Lexington.<!--/hint--> As the British troops approached them to find out
    why they had assembled, the members of this militia ran off in great
    confusion. <!--hint ref="1"-->During this time, several shots were fired
    at the British troops from behind a stone wall, a meeting house, and other
    homes. One British solider was wounded, and Major Pitcairn's horse was
    shot in two places.<!--/hint--> As a response to the rebels' attack, the
    British troops fired and killed several of them. Then, the troops
    continued marching to Concord unharmed.</p>

    Lexington. Their commanding officer yelled at the militia, "Disperse, you
    rebels, damn you, throw down your arms and disperse." <!--hint ref="1"-->The
    troops began hollering as one or two British officers fired their pistols.
    Four or five British soldiers fired their weapons. Then, the rest of the

    <h2>Deposition</h2>

    <p>The legal document below is the testimony of one of the colonists at
    the Battle of Lexington which happened on April 19, 1775 in Lexington,
    Massachusetts. The testimony was recorded seven days after the battle. How
    does Captain Parker want you to feel about the American colonists? How
    does he want you to feel about the British soldiers? What word choices
    does Captain Parker use to encourage you to form an opinion about each
    group? <!----></p>

    Militia)<br/> <strong>Year Created:</strong> April 26, 1775<br/>
    <strong>Type:</strong> Deposition<br/> </div>

    <p>I ordered our militia to meet on the common in Lexington to decide what
    to do about the approaching British army. We decided not to let them find
    us assembled there or to fight them unless they attacked us. <!--hint ref="2"--><!--hint ref="3"-->As
    the British army marched closer to us, I told our militia to leave and not
    to fire their weapons.<!--/hint--><!--/hint--> <!--hint ref="1"-->Suddenly,
    the British army arrived and immediately charged us, fired their weapons,
    and killed eight of our citizens.<!--/hint--> <!--hint ref="3"-->We did
    nothing to the British army to prompt their attack.<!--/hint--> </p>

    <h2>Diary Entry</h2>

    <p>The diary entry here was written by a British army soldier the same day
    as the Battle of Lexington, April 19, 1775. As you read through this
    document, think about how Lieutenant Barker describes the events leading
    up to the battle. What does Lieutenant Barker say happened? What words and
    details help you understand how the British soldiers were feeling,
    thinking, and acting? Does the fact that this is a diary entry make it
    more, or less, convincing to you? <!----></p>

    <div> <strong>Author:</strong> Lieutenant John Barker (British Army)<br/>
    <strong>Date:</strong> April 19, 1775<br/> <strong>Type:</strong> Diary
    Entry<br/> </div>

    <p>April 19th At 2 o'clock in the morning we marched across a river with
    water up to our waists. After marching a few more miles, we captured three
    or four people who were trying to warn the colonial militias that we were
    marching toward Concord. <!--hint ref="3"-->Later, when we were about five
    miles from Lexington, we were notified that a few hundred townspeople had
    gathered together to prevent us from moving forward. <!--hint ref="4"-->At
    5 o'clock we arrived at Lexington and saw between 200 and 300 people
    gathered in the middle of town.<!--/hint--> Though we knew that they might
    attach us,<!--/hint--> we marched forward without any intent to harm them.
    <!--hint ref="2"--><!--hint ref="1"-->As we got closer, they fired one or
    two shots at us.<!--/hint--> Then, without any orders to do so, our troops
    charged them, firing several shots.<!--/hint--> Several people from their
    militia were killed, but I am not sure how many because they were hidden
    behind walls and in the woods. Only one of our men from the 10th light
    infantry was wounded. Our troops were so wild that they could not hear our
    orders, and it was difficult to get them to reassemble at the common.
    After we did finally get them together, we waited there for some time
    there and then proceeded to Concord. </p>

    <h2>Etching</h2>

    <p>This drawing was created shortly after the Battle of Lexington, which
    happened on April 19, 1775, and was widely distributed throughout the
    American colonies. As you look at the image, think about how the artist’s
    choices show his opinion about what happened. What details might reveal
    the artist’s opinion about who was to blame for the battle? How are the
    British soldiers portrayed? How are the American colonists drawn? <!----></p>

    <h2>Report</h2>

    <p>This document is a report sent by a leader of the British troops at the
    Battle of Lexington to his commanding officer. The battle happened on
    April 19, 1775 and this report was sent seven days after the battle. As
    you read the report, look for how Major Pitcairn wants his commanding
    officer to view Pitcairn’s actions, the British soldiers, and the American
    colonists. What details show you how he wants the General to think about
    each of these? <!----></p>

    <strong>Date:</strong> April 26, 1775<br/> <strong>Type:</strong> Report
    to General Gage<br/> </div>

    <p>Sir,</p>

    <p>Since you are anxious to know what happened at Lexington on the 19th, I
    will be as clear as possible to state the facts.</p>

    <p><!--hint ref="2"-->As we marched toward Lexington, I told our troops
    not to even think about firing their weapons without my orders.<!--/hint-->
    <!--hint ref="4"-->When we arrived there, I saw about 200 rebels gathered
    at the green.<!--/hint--> As our troops got within 100 yards of them, they
    ran off behind a stone wall to our right. As our troops began running
    after them, <!--hint ref="2"-->I shouted that they were not to fire their
    weapons-that they should only surround and disarm the rebels<!--/hint-->.
    I repeated this order several times. <!--hint ref="1"--><!--hint ref="3"-->Then,
    some of the rebels who had hidden behind the wall shot four or five times
    at our troops, wounding one of our soldiers in the 10th light infantry. My
    horse was also wounded in two places. The rebels also began firing from a
    meeting house.<!--/hint--><!--/hint--> Without any orders to do so, our
    troops began firing at the rebels. This fighting continued for some time,
    even though the other officers and I repeatedly told our troops not to
    fire.</p>

    <p>I am, Sir, Your Most Obedient Humble Servant</p>

    <p>John Pitcairn</p>

    <h2>Sworn Deposition</h2>

    <p>The legal document below is a summary of testimony of twenty-one
    American colonists at the Battle of Lexington, gathered by Joseph Warren,
    an American colonist. The battle itself occurred on April 19, 1775 in
    Lexington, Massachusetts and this testimony was recorded seven days after
    the battle. How does Joseph Warren feel about the troops commanded by
    General Gage? How does he feel about the inhabitants of Lexington? What
    details help you discover how Warren feels? <!----></p>

    <strong>Title:</strong> To the Inhabitants of Great Britain<br/>
    <strong>Year Created:</strong> April 26, 1775<br/> <strong>Type:</strong>
    Sworn Deposition<br/> </div>

    <p>To: The inhabitants of Great Britain</p>

    <p>From: The Provincial Congress in Watertown; April 26, 1775 </p>

    <p>It is very important that you have a true and authentic account of what
    happened in Lexington on April 19th. </p>

    <p>The 21 testimonies we collected are from those who witnessed this
    inhumane event. It appears that they agree about the following: On the
    night before the 19th, our militia gathered at the common. They had been
    notified that the British army would be marching through our town on its
    way to Concord. <!--hint ref="3"-->When the army arrived, our militia
    began to peacefully disperse.<!--/hint--> <!--hint ref="1"-->The army,
    however, began to rush our militia and fire at them. They killed eight of
    our citizens and wounded several others.<!--/hint--> The army continued
    its attach until everyone from our militia, who was not dead or wounded,
    had escaped.</p>

    <p>Despite this horrible act of violence against us, we remain your
    brothers and will continue to be loyal subjects to our king. But we will
    not submit to the tyranny of his cruel ministry. With Heaven on our side,
    we shall die or be free.</p>

    <p>Joseph Warren</p>
